                My friend and I decide have pizza for dinner. 
                We order pizza which is half red sauce with pepperoni and half garlic sauce with ham and pineapple. 
                To my friend, pizza is pizza. He has no preference for one type of pizza over another. 
                On the other hand, I have an allergy to oregano and cannot eat any red sauce. 
                It gives me a horrible stomach ache and I'm grumpy for about eight hours.
            </p>

                        <p>
                            What is a fair way to divide this pizza so that my friend and I both believe we are getting a value of at least <m>50</m>% of the pizza.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            My friend never remembers that I do not eat red sauce. 
                            Therefore, he divides the pizza so that each half has exactly half red sauce and half garlic sauce. 
                            Am I able to choose a slice where I receive <m>50</m>% of the value of the pizza?
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Suppose instead, I slice the pizza. 
                            When I do so, because I value the red sauce part as nothing, I divide the pizza so that one slice is all garlic sauce and the other slice is all red sauce. 
                            Have I divided the pizza in such a way that each slice is worth <m>50</m>% to me?
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Is there a way that I could divide the pizza in order to have each slice worth <m>50</m>% to me and have all the red sauce on one of the slices?
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            In the case above, which of the slices with my friend choose?
                        </p>

                The basic issue at all fair division problems can be stated in a reasonably simple terms: How can something that must be shared by a set of competing parties be divided among them in a way that ensures that each party receives a fair share? Of course, part of the answer to this question will involve defining what we mean by a fair share.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are going to start with the most common method for fair division, that of the divider-chooser.
                This is the problem where there are two people and one thing to divide. 
                One person has chosen to do the cutting, and then the other person gets to choose which part they want.

            <answer>
                <p>
                   Each of the players is a thinking, rational agent seeking to maximize his or her share of the booty <m>S</m>.
                    We further assume that in pursuit of this goal, a player's moves are based on reason alone.

                <p>
                    The players are willing participants and accept the rules of the game as binding. The rules are such that after a <em>finite</em> number of moves by the players the game terminates with a division of <m>S</m>.

                   Players have no useful information on the other players' value systems, and thus if what kinds of moves they are going to make in the game.

            <answer>
                <p>
                  Players have <em>equal</em> rights in sharing the set <m>S</m>. 
                  A consequence of this assumption is that at a minimum, each player is entitled to a <em>proportional</em> share of <m>S</m>, that is <m>\frac{S}{N}</m> when there are <m>N</m> players.
