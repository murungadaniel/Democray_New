                    Sometimes it is easier to work with fair division problems when we put a monetary value on the object being divided because then we can quantify how much each piece is worth to each player. 
                    Suppose the cost of the pizza which is half red sauce and half white sauce is <m>$10</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol marker="(a)">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                               My friend never remembers that I do not eat red sauce.
                                Therefore, he divides the pizza so that each half has exactly half red sauce and half garlic sauce.
                                 How much is each slice of pizza worth to my friend? 
                                 How much is each slice of pizza worth to me? 
                            </p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Suppose instead, I slice the pizza.
                                When I do so, because I value the red sauce part as nothing, I divide the pizza so that one slice is all garlic sauce and the other slice is all red sauce. 
                                How much is each slice of pizza worth to me? How much of each slice of pizza worth to my friend? If I do the division, why is this not a fair division of the pizza? 
                                What happens if my friend is the one doing the division? Is it fair?
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Now, divide the pizza in such a way that all the red sauce is in one slice yet both slices are worth five dollars to me.
                                How much is each slice of the pizza worth to my friend?
                                If I do the division, why is this a fair division of the pizza? 
                                What happens if my friend is the one doing the division? Is it fair?
