                     The process of dividing the state into the appropriate number of 
					 districts is called <em>redistricting</em>, but in the popular press,
					 it is often referred to as <em>gerrymandering</em>. This is because 
					 the map-makers often decide to split things up to their benefit. 
					 One of the earliest, most obvious examples of this was in 1812 
					 when Massachusetts Governor Gerry and his party drew one district
					 in such a curvy and jagged manner that the local press thought it looked
					 like a salamander (see Figure <xref ref="fig-gerrymander" />) and 
					 coined the term <em>Gerrymander</em>.

        There are 50 people in this state who belong to two different political parties. 
		The census says that they should have 5 seats, so we need to divide up 
		these people into 5 groups.

        You will need these districting plans for the next two homework sets.
    </p>

    <p>
         R1. Consider the following map. The state has approximately orange (party A) people
		 and teal (party B) people (each color was selected randomly). Put 5 districts 
		 on the map so that teal (party B) receives the most seats.
    </p>

        R2. Put 5 districts on the map so that orange (party A) receives the most districts.
    </p>
    <image source="homework11R21.png" width="50%">

    <p>
         Add your districts to the next two homeworks as well. Make sure you have
		  5 districts with 5 squares in each district.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last diagram is an example of the ‘packing’ and ‘cracking’ 
         that are illustrative of modern gerrymandering
    </p>
    <p>
         <m>\textbf{ packing}</m> Putting a very large number of voters who all vote the same way 
         in a single district. In this case, the election is won by these voters, 
         but by a very large margin.
    </p>
    <p>
         <m>\textbf{cracking}</m> Putting a slight majority of voters for one party in a single
         district. In this case, the election is won by these voters by a slim margin. 
         There are a lot of minority voters in the district, but not enough
         to ever win an election.
    </p>
    <p>
         4. The state below has approximately <m>40%</m> orange () 
         60% teal ( ) people (each color was selected randomly). Divide the state     into 10 districts in such a way so
         that in an election 40% of the seats will be won by the orange
         people and <m>60%</m> by the teal people.

         5. Now, divide the same state in such a way so that <m>60%</m> of the seats 
         will be won by the orange people.
