    <title>Geometric Measures</title>
        <p>
             Although most states have a requirement that their districts
             be compact, there is no good definition for how compact a set of districts
             would be. We will look at two different ways of measuring compactness. 
             To make measurement easier, we will be using our example districts from before
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Area vs. Perimeter</term>
             One way of measuring how compact a district is comes from dividing 
             the area of the district by its perimeter squared and then 
             multiplying by <m>16</m>

             You multiply by <fn> 16 because the Isoperimetric measure
             for a square is <m>\frac{1}{16}</m> and we would like our ratio
             to be about 1 </fn>.  In general, this type of calculation is 
             known as an Isoperimetric measure.

						 Does the calculation differentiate between the plans?
                         h Does it show one plan as being <q>better</q> than the others?

                                 your notion of compact, which would you use and why?

							 If you were to argue for a method of measurement that would be 
                             able to identify whether or not a district was gerrymandered 
                             and it wasnâ€™t either of the ones we have looked at, what would
                              it be? What would you be trying to identify?
