      Okay, so maybe just looking geometrically at how the districts are drawn is not
      a good way of testing how fair a redistricting is. Maybe there is something about
      the election and where the people who live in the district are placed that would help
      us measure the fairness of the redistricting plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Efficiency gap:</term> A state has been divided into 5 districts of 100 voters each.
      Each district votes to elect a representative from one of two parties,
      <m>A</m> or <m>B</m>. In any election, many voters will end up feeling
      that voting was a waste of their time. A voter could feel this way for
      two reasons:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Her party lost, so what was the point of showing up to vote?</li>
        <li>Her party won by a landslide, so what was the point of showing up to vote?</li>
        <li>All votes for party <m>A</m> are wasted if party <m>A</m> loses.</li>
        <li>All votes above 50% for party <m>A</m> are wasted if party <m>A</m> wins.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      <p>
        Complete the following table. Use <m>W_A</m> for wasted votes by A, and <m>W_B</m> for B.
      </p>

    <p>
      The <term>Efficiency Gap</term> is defined to be the fraction of the difference of wasted votes
     divided by the total number of votes:
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>EG = \frac{W_A - W_B}{\text{Total Votes}}</me>
    </p>

    <p>
     The <m>V</m> in the denominator normalized  <m>EG</m>, so that its magnitude does not depend on
     the population of the state. The idea is that when  <m>EG</m> is much larger than <m>0</m>, the
     districting plan may be unfair to party  <m>A</m>, because  <m>A</m>is wasting more votes. When <m>EG</m>
     is much smaller than <m>0</m>, then <m>B</m> is wasting more votes, so the plan may be unfair
     to  <m>B</m>. We do have to be careful because if a candidate is running unopposed, the
     efficiency gap for that election is meaningless. We can either throw out that district in
     our calculations or use data from other elections to estimate what the election would
     look like if the seat were contested.

    <p>
     Fill out the table. Which districts show signs of <term>packing</term>, that is putting all the
     voters of one party together so that, although they win the district, they have a lot of wasted votes.
       
    </p>
    <p>
     Which districts show signs of <term>cracking</term>, that is putting just enough voters of the
     opposing party in the district so that they are confident of winning the election and
     therefore the first party has a lot of wasted votes?
    </p>
    
        <p>
         <term>R9</term>. Go back to the 5 districts you drew on the map (or draw new ones) so that teal
         receives the most seats. Assuming that each square represents 100 voters, what
         is the efficiency gap for your plan 3 ?
