    <title>Redistricting</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            According to the Supreme Court, the Constitution requires that population 
            must be equalized across districts. The idea is that if one Iowan lives 
            in a district with 1 million other voters while another Iowan lives 
            in a district with only 200,000 other voters, the second oneâ€™s vote 
            is more influential in choosing a member of Congress. Of course, 
            populations shift, growing or shrinking over time.
        </p>   
        <p>
            To prevent those shifts from leaving unbalanced districts, state 
            legislatures must redraw their electoral districts every 10 years, 
            after the Census Bureau releases its new population data. Redistricting 
            regularly leads to heated political and legal fights as legislators 
            scramble to gain advantage for their parties.

            Once the census has been taken and all the numbers have been added up 
            and the apportionment problem has been solved (up to the Supreme Court 
            if necessary), it is time to divide up each state into 
            districts (one per representative). Some of the rules of 
            redistricting are:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Population must be equalized across districts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Each district must be (if possible) physically connected.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, each state has more rules that they have decided on. 
            In most states, the party in power when the census data comes out 
            gets to draw in district lines for Federal Representatives and 
            all state offices that need districts. This process is done by 
            hand, often block by block. In 2011, the new field of data science 
            made it possible for whoever was in charge to manipulate the
            lines in such a way that their majority was nearly guaranteed in 
            the near future.
