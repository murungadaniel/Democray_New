				Weighted voting systems are when there are <m>n</m> voters labeled <m>P_1\dots P_n</m>, and each voter casts a vote with a certain weight, <m>w_i</m>. Think of this as having each voter being able to cast <m>w_i</m> votes all for the same decision. In order for a motion to pass, the sum of all the votes needs to be at least <m>q</m>, the quota. We need the quota to be more than 50% of the sum of all the votes and no more than the sum of all the votes, but it can be anything in between. We give a weighted voting system as <m>[q|w_1,w_2,\dots,w_n]</m>.

					In <m>1958</m>, the Treaty of Rome established the European Economic Community (EEC) and instituted a weighted voting system for the EEC's governance. The members at that time were France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The three largest countries (France, Germany and Italy) were each given a vote with weight 4, Belgium and the Netherlands had votes of weight 2 and Luxembourg's vote had weight 1. The quota was <m>12</m>.

					What is unusual or interesting about this weighted voting system?
